# Gatsby Starter ThePuzzlers Core

A simplified bare-bones website starter for ThePuzzlers. 

## How to use ThePuzzlers Starters
Since the gatsby starter is in a private repo, we must download it locally:

1a. **Download this repo on your computer** 
```sh
    git clone git@gitlab.com:thepuzzlers-org/websites/thepuzzlers-website-starter.git
``` 

1b. **If you already have it, make sure you have the latest version**
```sh
    git pull
```

2a. **Assuming you have gastby installed globally, make sure your gatsby config is set to use `yarn` as the package manager. To change it type:**
```sh
    gatsby options set package-manager yarn
```

2. **Create your new gatsby site with the starter** 
```sh
    gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY] [LOCAL_PATH_TO_STARTER]
```

3. **Change into your new directory** 
```sh
    cd [SITE_DIRECTORY]
```

4. **Launch the site**
```sh
    yarn develop
```
